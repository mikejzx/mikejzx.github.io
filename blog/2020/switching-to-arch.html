				<span class="sntc">Switching to Arch</span>

			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">Around this time last year &#40;a bit earlier actually&mdash;October or so&#41;, I decided to make the switch to using a Linux distribution as my daily driver &#40;while also dual&#45;booting Windows&#41;.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Just like everyone else, I distrohopped until I found the distro that I felt was &ldquo;just right&rdquo;.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I settled on Xubuntu&mdash;a nice flavour of Ubuntu that runs the good ol&rsquo; XFCE4 desktop environment.</span>
				<span class="sntc">It just seemed like a nice, fairly snappy operating system.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Below is a screenshot of what my system looked like from about April to around last week: </span>
			</p>

			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">It looked nice and all for a while, but recently I was getting sick of it.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I decided it was time to change it up a bit; I decided to try out Arch</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">I had used Arch Linux for the past year or so on an old laptop of mine &#40;this same laptop is where I had installed Ubuntu for the first time years ago!&#41;.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had played around with Arch occasionally, and I thought it seemed like a really cool and extensible distribution.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I felt like I had loads more flexibility, and that I knew the system better because I had installed everything on it myself from the ground&#45;up.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">So, last weekend I got my desktop prepared for a new install of Arch &#40;cleaned up file&#47;directory structure&#41; and put the ISO on a trusty USB.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I went ahead with the install&mdash;it took me two attempts &lsquo;till I got a functioning system.</span>
				<span class="sntc">It seemed like the latest 5.9 kernel just doesn&rsquo;t like my hardware or something.</span>
				<span class="sntc">The second time around I went with the LTS kernel, and all went well.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">I booted into my new system, and installed whatever essential packages I needed &#40;i.e. Neovim, etc&#41;.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had decided beforehand that I&rsquo;d go with Openbox as my window manager, so that&rsquo;s what I installed and ran initially.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had played around with it, got the basic things configured.</span>
				<span class="sntc">However, I soon discovered that Openbox does not have the ability to &ldquo;hide window contents while dragging windows&rdquo; &#40;see <a href="http://www.lxle.net/forums/discussion/778/hide-window-content-while-dragging/p1">here</a>, things haven&rsquo;t changed since then apparently&#41;.</span>
				<span class="sntc">It&rsquo;s a really small feature, but something I really wanted to have, as it just makes the system feel a lot snappier.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Nevertheless, I discovered quickly that the <b>Fluxbox</b> window manager actually supports this feature.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had basically never used Fluxbox before &#40;maybe once or twice as a test&#41;, but decided to give it a shot anyway.</span>
				<span class="sntc">And boy, I&rsquo;m glad I did!</span>
				<span class="sntc">Fluxbox&rsquo;s man pages are pretty comprehensive &#40;thankfully, as there isn&rsquo;t much online resources unfortunately&#41;, so I was able to get it configured fairly quickly.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I was very impressed with how customisable and simple Fluxbox actually is.</span>
				<span class="sntc">It was basically just what I had been looking for.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I was able to adjust it to suit my workflow, using some keybinds such as the following:</span>
			</p>
			<pre>
&#35; Close window
Mod4 Q :Close
&#35; Make window fullscreen
Mod1 F11 :Fullscreen
&#35; Tile window vertically to the left&#47;right.
Mod4 Left :MacroCmd &#123;ResizeTo 50&#37; 100&#37;&#125; &#123;MoveTo 0&#37; 0&#37; TopLeft&#125;
Mod4 Right :MacroCmd &#123;ResizeTo 50&#37; 100&#37;&#125; &#123;MoveTo 0&#37; 0&#37; TopRight&#125;
&#35; Maximise window
Mod4 Up :Maximize
&#35; Restore window if maximised, minimise it if restored.
&#35; The call to 'Maximize' here is a hack that is used to actually
&#35; 'Restore' the maximised window, since there doesn't seem to be
&#35; any 'Restore' command &#40;at least not in the build of Fluxbox
&#35; that is in the Arch repos&#41;.
Mod4 Down :If &#123;Matches &#40;Maximized&#61;yes&#41;&#125; &#123;Maximize&#125; &#123;Minimize&#125;
&#35; Launch script that moves window to other monitor:
&#35; See my dotfiles for the script, I can't find the original author:
&#35; https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;mikejzx&#47;dotfiles
Mod1 Shift N :Exec &#36;HOME&#47;src&#47;scripts&#47;misc&#47;move&#45;to&#45;next&#45;monitor.sh
&#35; A pretty cool command that tiles windows in master&#47;slave format.
Mod4 A :If &#123;Matches &#40;Layer!&#61;Desktop&#41;&#125; &#123;ArrangeWindowsStackRight &#40;Name!&#61;tint2&#41;&#125;
&#35; Launch Rofi to search for programs.
Mod4 S :Exec rofi &#45;show combi &#45;combi&#45;modi "drun,run" &#45;modi combi			</pre>

				<span class="sntc">Those are the main window management keybinds that I&rsquo;m using, and they get the job done great.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I haven&rsquo;t tinkered with workspaces yet, since they seem a bit awkward to use on a dual&#45;monitor setup with a floating window manager.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Maybe in future I&rsquo;ll try work something out.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">After getting Fluxbox &#40;and everything else on the system&#41; configured, it was time to theme the damn thing!</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had initially been using the &rsquo;bloe&rsquo; theme that came with Fluxbox, since I thought it actually looked decent, and sort of retro&#45;ey.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Thing is, I just wanted a dark version of it!</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">Well, I decided to go ahead and make my own dark version of it.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I mean, it took some tweaking, but eventually I was able to get something that I was actually pleased with.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I only ended up editing the pixmaps that I was actually using, so that is&mdash;close&#47;restore&#47;minimise buttons, window titlebars, etc.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">I had to find a GTK theme that went well the Fluxbox theme.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Man, it was a pain in the ass, but I did eventually discover a theme called &lsquo;Vertex&rsquo;, which I think worked well with it.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I did just slightly modify the colours of the toolbar&#47;window menus of GTK2 windows, and also removed all &rsquo;transitions&rsquo; that I could find&mdash;since I don&rsquo;t like them very much.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">Finally, I had to get my panel configured.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I had installed Tint2 pretty early on, while I was experimenting with Openbox, and yeah it&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I was able to configure it pretty much just how I wanted.</span>
				<span class="sntc">The other day I even put this crazy gradient on it, which when paired with a blur effect &#40;thanks to Tryone144&rsquo;s fork of the Picom compositor&#41;, made it look a bit like the Windows Vista taskbar.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to mimick it really, but I think it goes quite well with the rest of the theme.</span>
				<span class="sntc">I guess it can be considered a bit of a &ldquo;retro&rdquo; look now, since interfaces haven&rsquo;t had that sort of thing in years.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Here&rsquo;s the gradient I used to achieve it:</span>
			</p>
			<pre>
gradient &#61; vertical
start&#95;color &#61; &#35;404040 55
color&#95;stop &#61; 50.000000 &#35;4a4a4a 55
color&#95;stop &#61; 52.000000 &#35;0c0c0c 30
color&#95;stop &#61; 93.000000 &#35;0a0a0a 30
color&#95;stop &#61; 94.000000 &#35;ffffff 10
color&#95;stop &#61; 96.000000 &#35;ffffff 10
color&#95;stop &#61; 98.000000 &#35;000000 100
end&#95;color &#61; &#35;000000 100			</pre>
			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">And here&rsquo;s the resulting desktop.</span>
				<span class="sntc">A bit of a throwback to the late 2000s days of computing I guess.</span>
				<span class="sntc">It definitely won&rsquo;t suit everyone&rsquo;s tastes, but it suits mine!</span>
				<span class="sntc"></span>

			<p class="sentspc">
				<span class="sntc">Oh, and I just thought this was really cool too&mdash;this is from the Tint2 panel on my left monitor.</span>
				<span class="sntc">Got a nice MPD status display there with a play&#47;pause icon!</span>
				<span class="sntc">Of course clicking it also runs &lsquo;mpc toggle&lsquo;.</span>
				<span class="sntc"></span>
