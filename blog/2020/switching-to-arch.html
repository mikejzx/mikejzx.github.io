<h1 id="Switching%20to%20Arch">Switching to Arch</h1>

<p class="date">2020-12-04</p>

<p>Around this time last year (a bit earlier actually - October or so) I decided to make the switch to using a Linux distribution as my daily driver (while also dual-booting Windows). Just like everyone else, I distrohopped until I found the distro that I felt was &#8220;just right&#8221;. I settled on Xubuntu - a nice flavour of Ubuntu that runs the good ol&#8217; XFCE4 desktop environment. It just seemed like a nice, fairly snappy operating system. Below is a screenshot of what my system looked like from about April to around last week:</p>

<p>So yeah. It looked nice and all for a while, but recently I was getting sick of it. I decided it was time to switch to Arch.</p>

<p>I had used Arch for the past year or so on an old laptop of mine (this same laptop is where I had installed Ubuntu for the first time years ago!). I had played around with Arch occasionally, and I thought it seemed like a really cool and extensible distribution. I felt like I had loads more flexibility, and that I knew the system better because I had installed everything on it myself from the ground-up.</p>

<p>So, last weekend I got my desktop prepared for a new install of Arch (cleaned up file&#47;directory structure) and put the ISO on a trusty USB. I went ahead with the install - it took me two attempts &#8216;till I got a functioning system. It seemed like the latest 5.9 kernel just doesn&#39;t like my hardware or something. The second time around I went with the LTS kernel, and all went well.</p>

<p>I booted into my new system, and installed whatever essential packages I needed (i.e Neovim, etc). I had decided beforehand that I&#39;d go with Openbox as my window manager, so that&#39;s what I installed and ran initially. I had played around with it, got the basic things configured. However, I soon discovered that Openbox does not have the ability to &#8220;hide window contents while dragging windows&#8221; (see <a href="http://www.lxle.net/forums/discussion/778/hide-window-content-while-dragging/p1">here</a>, things haven&#39;t changed since then apparently). It&#39;s a really small feature, but something I really wanted to have, as it just makes the system feel so much snappier!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I discovered quickly that the <strong>Fluxbox</strong> window manager actually supports this feature. I had basically never used Fluxbox before (maybe once or twice as a test), but decided to give it a shot anyway. And boy, I&#39;m glad I did! Fluxbox&#39;s man pages are pretty comprehensive (thank god, there isn&#39;t much online resources unfortunately), so I was able to get it configured fairly quickly.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with how customisable and simple Fluxbox actually is. It was basically just what I had been looking for. I was able to adjust it to suit my workflow, using some keybinds such as the following:</p>

<pre><code># Close window
Mod4 Q :Close

# Make window fullscreen
Mod1 F11 :Fullscreen

# Tile window vertically to the left&#47;right.
Mod4 Left :MacroCmd {ResizeTo 50% 100%} {MoveTo 0% 0% TopLeft}
Mod4 Right :MacroCmd {ResizeTo 50% 100%} {MoveTo 0% 0% TopRight}

# Maximise window
Mod4 Up :Maximize

# Restore window if maximised, minimise it if restored.
# The call to &#39;Maximize&#39; here is a hack that is used to actually
# &#39;Restore&#39; the maximised window, since there doesn&#39;t seem to be
# any &#39;Restore&#39; command (at least not in the build of Fluxbox
# that is in the Arch repos).
Mod4 Down :If {Matches (Maximized=yes)} {Maximize} {Minimize}

# Launch script that moves window to other monitor:
# See my dotfiles for the script, I can&#39;t find the original author:
# https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;mikejzx&#47;dotfiles
Mod1 Shift N :Exec $HOME&#47;src&#47;scripts&#47;misc&#47;move-to-next-monitor.sh

# A pretty cool command that tiles windows in master&#47;slave format.
Mod4 A :If {Matches (Layer!=Desktop)} {ArrangeWindowsStackRight (Name!=tint2)}

# Launch Rofi to search for programs.
Mod4 S :Exec rofi -show combi -combi-modi "drun,run" -modi combi
</code></pre>

<p>So yeah. Those are the main window management keybinds that I&#39;m using, and they get the job done great. I haven&#39;t tinkered with workspaces yet, since they seem a bit awkward to use on a dual-monitor setup with a floating window manager. Maybe in future I&#39;ll try work something out.</p>

<p>After getting Fluxbox (and everything else on the system) configured, it was time to theme the damn thing! I had initially been using the &#8216;bloe&#8217; theme that came with Fluxbox, since I thought it actually looked decent, and sort of retro-ey. Thing is, I just wanted a dark version of it!</p>

<p>Well, I decided to go ahead and make my own dark version of it. I mean, it took some tweaking, but eventually I was able to get something that I was actually pleased with. I only ended up editing the pixmaps that I was actually using, so that is - close&#47;restore&#47;minimise buttons, window titlebars, etc.</p>

<p>I had to find a GTK theme that went well the Fluxbox theme. Man, it was a pain in the ass, but I did eventually discover a theme called &#8216;Vertex&#8217;, which I think worked well with it. I did just slightly modify the colours of the toolbar&#47;window menus of GTK2 windows, and also removed all &#8216;transitions&#8217; that I could find - since I don&#39;t like them very much.</p>

<p>Finally, I had to get my panel configured. I had installed Tint2 pretty early on, while I was experimenting with Openbox, and yeah it&#39;s pretty awesome. I was able to configure it pretty much just how I wanted. The other day I even put this crazy gradient on it, which when paired with a blur effect (thanks to Tryone144&#39;s fork of the Picom compositor), made it look a bit like the Windows Vista taskbar. I mean, I wasn&#39;t trying to mimick it really, but I think it goes quite well with the rest of the theme. I guess it can be considered a bit of a &#8220;retro&#8221; look now, since interfaces haven&#39;t had that sort of thing in years. Here&#39;s the gradient I used to achieve it:</p>

<pre><code>gradient = vertical
start_color = #404040 55
color_stop = 50.000000 #4a4a4a 55
color_stop = 52.000000 #0c0c0c 30
color_stop = 93.000000 #0a0a0a 30
color_stop = 94.000000 #ffffff 10
color_stop = 96.000000 #ffffff 10
color_stop = 98.000000 #000000 100
end_color = #000000 100
</code></pre>

<p>And here&#39;s the resulting desktop. A bit of a throwback to the late 2000s days of computing I guess. It definitely won&#39;t suit everyone&#39;s tastes, but it suits mine!</p>

<p>Oh, and I just thought this was really cool too - this is from the Tint2 panel on my left monitor. Got a nice MPD status display there with a play&#47;pause icon! Of course clicking it also runs <code>mpc toggle</code>.</p>

<p><img src="img/switching_to_arch_screen_2020-12-04_left.webp" alt="Tint2 on other monitor" /></p>

<p>And that&#39;s it. As of now, I&#39;ve put my dotfiles on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/mikejzx/dotfiles">here</a> for my own sake really, but if you&#39;re interested or were wondering how I did something, feel free to take a look - most of it should be there.</p>
