<h1 id="New%20Site%20and%20Blog!">New Site and Blog!</h1>


<p>Welcome to my new site!</p>

<p>So these past few days I have been working on re-writing this site from the ground up, and getting a blog component implemented. I was totally inspired to do so after seeing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ttw2Dihn8">video posted on YouTube by Wolfgang,</a> and after coming across <a href="https://tarunbatra.com/blog/x/git-before-github/">this awesome article</a> by accident. (The subject of the article is irrelevant, I just liked the way he laid out his site). I figured I&#39;d try make my own &#8220;blog&#8221;, even though I know that literally like nobody would be reading it. I just thought it be a bit entertaining.</p>

<p>Thanks to Roman Zolotarev for his <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">script</a>, which is the subject of the video I linked above. Without his work, we&#39;d all be stuck using bloated static site generators like Hexo.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s all really. Don&#39;t expect me to post here very often - I have some ideas for what to do, but not sure when I&#39;ll get round to posting them.</p>
